Cleaning Data Project
===================

This repository is for John's Hopkins University's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. It is the third course in the Data Science Specialization on Coursera. The goal of the proejct is to perform transformations and summary analysis on a large and dirty datset.

### Description
Description: This repository contains the original data, a script called "run_analysis.r" which performs transformations on the data, an example tidy dataset, and lastly a code book to describe exactly what transformations are made. 

### Brief Script Summary
- The original dataset includes 10922 records of 561 variables of 30 individuals performing 1 of 6 activities. 
- This script reads in all of the data, and extracts only the variables that are measures of mean and standard deviation. 
- The script then takes the mean of each variable for each person and for each activity. 
- The final result is a data set of 30 records, each record contains the mean of the variable for a specific activity.
